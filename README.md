# **EE551 Project**
This project is to write a blackjack game in python.
## **Basic rules:**
1. Set the game to best of n (n=3,5,7,9,...)
2. The players are human and computer players.
3. There are 13 cards, from 1 to 13.
4. Start with two cards each player, the first card is invisible and the second of which can be seen by the opponent.
5. The human player starts to ask for a card, and then the opponent asks for a card, and then the human player asks, and so on. Until both sides stop asking for cards. If the sum of points of whom is greater than 21, that player can not ask for a card.
6. Count the points of each players. If both are less than 21, the side close to 21 wins (the same is a draw). If both are greater than or equal to 21, it's a draw. If one is greater than 21 and the other one is less than or equal to 21, the less one wins.
7. One point for victory, no points for failure
## **Future may implement**
1. Add the betting system and replace the scoring system.
2. Add a series of function cards to the deck.
   May include: Directly obtain a certain number of cards; Discard the last card you asked; Discard your opponent's last   card and so on.
